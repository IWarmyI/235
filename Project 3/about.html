    <h4>Graphics</h4>
    <p>In terms of graphics, I'm aiming for a cartoony feel and definitely a light look on everything. There will be a timer and score counter left on the sides of the screen for the player to get information about their progress as well as a high score that will be kept locally.</p>

    <h4>Gameplay</h4>
    <p>The user will be able to select cards with their mouse and will learn from just clicking around and discovered the ability to select cards. After the user finishes all cards on screen and new set will show with more cards creating a new level. There will be 3 levels with the user gaining points for correct matches and losing points for incorrect matches. <br><br> To advance a level, an AI enemy will be shown with a set amount of health that the player must defeat or have more points than once all cards are gone. The AI will have the same scoring applied and can defeat you if it makes half of the available matches.</p>
