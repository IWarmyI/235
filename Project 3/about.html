        <h1>Princess Match!</h1>
        <h3>Darvin Muralitharan</h3>
    </header>

    <p>You are a knight out to slay the dragon and save the princess. Race to match all cards as fast as possible to save the princess before time runs out!</p>

    <p>Genre: Card</p>
    
    <p>Platform: Desktop Web</p>

    <p>The King's daughter has been kidnapped and he appoints he top knight, you, to go out and rescue her.</p>

    <p>In terms of graphics, I'm aiming for a cartoony feel and definitely a light look on everything. There will be a timer and score counter left on the sides of the screen for the player to get information about their progress as well as a high score that will be kept locally.</p>

    <p>The user will be able to select cards with their mouse and will learn from just clicking around and discovered the ability to select cards. After the user finishes all cards on screen and new set will show with more cards creating a new level. There will be 3 levels with the user gaining points for correct matches and losing points for incorrect matches.</p>
