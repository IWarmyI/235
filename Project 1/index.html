                <p>
                    As I was growing up, video games always facinated me. As I grew up, that facination began to shape into a more concrete form in programming. Now, I'm a second-year Game Design & Development Student at RIT from Henrietta, New York. I enjoy taking on various challenges concerning programming in Unity and HTML.

                    <p>
                        The Amiibo Finder utilizes the <a href="https://www.amiiboapi.com/docs/" target="display">AmiiboAPI</a> to filter out amiibos through various filters such as character names, game series, amiibo series, or a combination of them all. This project was made during my time in Intro To Game Web Tech at RIT and was my first step into understanding how to utilize an API. Figuring out how to load options for series through the API was definitely a big challenge as I had never tried such a thing before and a lot of guessing was made to make it but I'm happy with the way it turned out, making the code more optimized in the process. <a href="https://people.rit.edu/dm1250/235/project2/" target="display">Feel free to try it out!</a>

                    <p>
                        Princess Match! is a small game I developed using the browser DOM for a final project in Intro To Game Web Tech at RIT that has the player aim to match cards to affect an enemy they fight in each level. The original scope was much larger than anticipated with an included timer and health for the player to manage in the game. Although small, I'm proud of what was done for the project and definitely plan to flesh it out even more with some more features such as the player health and an AI to play against. <a href="https://people.rit.edu/dm1250/235/project3/" target="display">You can play the game here!</a>

                    <h2>Z-Bomber</h2>
                    <p>
                        Z-Bomber is a small game I made in Unity, built to WebGL, in my Interactive Media Development class at RIT. The player can be difficult to control but the main focus of the project was the implementation of <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/" target="display">Reynold's steering behavior for autonomous agents</a> which are the zombies in this case. They use a variety of forces to avoid each other, obstacles, and the edge of the map all while chasing after you to get a bite. The player can use bombs dropping them with the 'Spacebar' to protect themselves while trying to run away with 'WASD'. Developing the steering forces was definitely a big challenge as it's hard to get forces to come out exactly right, especially when trying to make it in a simulation. <a href="https://igme-202-2211.github.io/project-3-IWarmyI/" target="display">You can check it out here!</a>
